ðŸŽ¯ WHAT THIS FIXES:

1. DEVELOPMENT MODE BYPASS:
   - Completely skips middleware in development mode
   - No auth checks, no redirects, just lets everything through
   - Perfect for testing and development

2. PRODUCTION MODE ONLY:
   - Auth checks only happen in production
   - Protects your admin routes when deployed
   - Maintains security when needed

3. FLEXIBLE ROUTING:
   - Allows both /admin/login and /admin/dev-dashboard
   - No conflicts with bypass mechanisms
   - Clean separation of concerns

TO USE:
1. Replace your current middleware.ts with this code
2. Make sure NODE_ENV=development (should be automatic in dev)
3. Your bypass buttons should now work perfectly
4. Dashboard should be accessible directly

WHY YOUR ORIGINAL MIDDLEWARE FAILED:
- It was always checking for tokens, even in development
- It redirected EVERY request to /admin routes without tokens
- It didn't have a development mode bypass
- It caused infinite loops between login and dashboard

NOW IT WILL WORK:
âœ… Development: No auth checks, everything works
âœ… Production: Full auth protection
âœ… Bypass buttons: Will work perfectly
âœ… Direct navigation: Works in development
